EasyOVS Installation/Configuration Notes
----------------------------------------

EasyOVS 0.2
---

The supported installation methods for EasyOVS are
1) using a pre-built VM image, and
2) native installation on common Linux distribution,
such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.
3) You can also easily create your own EasyOVS VM image
4) Other distributions may be supported in the future - if you would
like to contribute an installation script, we would welcome it!

1. Easiest "installation" - use our pre-built VM image!

   The easiest way to get EasyOVS running is to start with one of our
   pre-built virtual machine images from <https://github.com/yeasy/easyOVS>

   Boot up the VM image, log in, and follow the instructions on the
   EasyOVS web site.

   One advantage of using the VM image is that it doesn't mess with
   your native OS installation or damage it in any way.

2. Native installation from source

2.1. Native installation from source on Ubuntu,Debian,CentOS and Fedora

   If you're reading this, you've probably already done so, but the
   command to download the EasyOVS source code is:

        git clone git://github.com/yeasy/easyovs.git

   If you are running Ubuntu, you may be able to use our handy
   `install.sh` script, which is in `easyovs/util`.

   *WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!*

   To install ALL of the software which is potentially useful software,
   you may use:

        sudo easyovs/util/install.sh -a

   The time depends on the network quality and your machine performance.
   This takes about 1 minutes on our test system.

   You can change the directory where the dependencies are installed using
   the -s <directory> flag.

        sudo easyovs/util/install.sh -s <directory> -a

3. Installation on other Linux distributions

   Although we don't support other Linux distributions directly, it
   should be possible to install and run EasyOVS with some degree of
   manual effort.

   In general, you must have:

   * Python, `bash`, `git`, `make`, etc.

   * Root privileges (required for network device access)

   We encourage contribution of patches to the `install.sh` script to
   support other Linux distributions.

Good luck!
